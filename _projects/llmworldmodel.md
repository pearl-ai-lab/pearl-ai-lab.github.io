World models generally refer to generative models of the transition functions in an MDP, able to aid an agent in selecting an optimal set of actions to complete a given task.
LLMs, for all their internet scale knowledge, still struggle to be effective world models (see [here](https://mark-riedl.medium.com/toward-agi-what-is-missing-c2f0d878471a)) for embodied agents.
And yet there is incredible potential in using large-scale data especially in the form of language to aid agents, we as people are able to read information via language and form generalizable world models internally that helps us achieve tasks.
This project focuses on realizing such potential.
