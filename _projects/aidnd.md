D&D is a role-playing game consisting of multiple player characters and a Dungeon Master (DM) who collaborate to achieve a set of goals beneficial to the players. 
The DM, the narrator and host of the game, has an innate motivation to guide the players to perform a series of actions that roughly follow a predevised storyline culminating in a global goal, all grounded in a shared fantasy world.
The players must somewhat: (1) keep their characterâ€™s personas consistent while acting; (2) keep track of relationships between characters that will affect their interactions; and (3) follow and logically advance the plot of the story.
