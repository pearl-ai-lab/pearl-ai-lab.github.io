The PEARLS (Pragmatically Exploring Agents with Reinforced LanguageS) Lab at UCSD CSE is motivated by the question of how to imbue learning agents with the ability to understand and generate contextually relevant natural language in service of achieving a goal. This work lies primarily at the intersection of **Machine Learning**, especially **Reinforcement Learning**, and **Natural Language Processing**. The core theme of our research involves creating **trustworthy and responsible language-based AI agents** that are able to: (1) interactively gather and **align to human preferences via feedback**; and (2) build and use **neurosymbolic world models** that guide the agent's actions in **grounded environments**.
